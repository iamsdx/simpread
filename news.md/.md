The Nigerian superstar performed a live-piano medley of the lead singles off his latest album, [UY Scuti](https://grungecake.com/olamide-uy-scuti/articles/78421), ‘[Rock](https://grungecake.com/olamide-rock/articles/77153)’ and ‘[Julie](https://grungecake.com/olamide-julie-video/articles/79499)’. Since its release on June 17, ‘UY Scuti’ has been the number one album on Audiomack, with over 58 million plays in less than two months.

“Olamide is a once-in-a-lifetime talent,” says Jason Johnson, Vice President of Marketing and Brand Strategy for Audiomack. “He is one of the highest streaming artists on our platform. He has amassed over 250 million + streams and his most recent album UY Scuti has been number 1 on the platform since its release on June 17. We are looking forward to helping him reach new fans globally and provide a platform for his existing fans to experience his music in new ways.”

‘Fine Tuned’ has quickly become one of the most popular original music series in the industry, with artists being invited to strip their most popular tracks down to the bare essentials for a once-in-a-lifetime performance. Rappers such as G Herbo, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Moneybagg Yo, Kevin Gates, and Jack Harlow have performed, as have afrobeats and dancehall artists like as [Davido](https://grungecake.com/dababy-davido-collaboration/articles/78763), Mr Eazi, Alkaline, and Konshens.
